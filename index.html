                    <p>Hello, my name is Pranav, and I am a second-year student at the University of Michigan studing Computer Science with a strong interest in Full Stack Development, Artificial Intelligence / Automation, and Machine Learning.</p>
                    <p>Currently, I'm looking into various full time opportunities to pursue in the near future. This past summer I interned at Ratna Global Technologies as a Software Engineer on a web design and development team where I gained tremendous industry experience and insights.</p>
                    <p>My passion lies in informing younger students about mistakes I made to help them avoid critical mistakes I made in highschool and the process of applying to college.</p>
