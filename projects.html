                         <h2>Contracting with Multinational Firms<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Jan 2022 - April 2023</span></h2>
                             <p>The present study aims to shed light on the costs and benefits of internal and external contracts by conducting a comparative analysis of the risk and compliance data coded from a
                              sample of such contracts. By isolating relevant statements and paragraphs using Google Sheets and logging the data for further analysis, we identify differences in how firms manage
                              risks with exchange partners versus their own units.<br><br>
                              The present study employed data coding to conduct an analysis of internal and external contracts, with a focus on the management of risks associated with exchange partners as
                              compared to risks related to a firm's own units. Our findings reveal that external contracts feature a significantly higher number of risk clauses compared to their internal counterparts.
                              This pattern of risk allocation suggests that firms tend to transfer a greater proportion of risk to their external partners in comparison to their internal units.<br><br>
                              One possible explanation for this disparity is rooted in the issue of accountability. Given that external contracts frequently involve partnerships with entities situated in foreign
                              jurisdictions, ensuring compliance with local laws and regulations can pose a significant challenge. The potential lack of accountability in such arrangements may induce firms to
                              incorporate more risk clauses in their external contracts as a means of mitigating potential legal and financial liabilities.</p><br>

                            <h2>Elevator Game<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Feb 2023 - Mar 2023</span></h2>
                             <p>Elevators is a project that dabbles in Game Design, Artificial Intelligence, and designing real-world systems. Using C++, completed an implementation for a game in which the player operates 3 elevators in a busy building, making decisions and servicing requests to keep the people inside the building as happy as possible.<br><br>
                              Implemented the core gameplay of the Elevator game including the high-level architecture of the project, and ensuring that each piece built works correctly and fits together into one cohesive experience. Developed an artificial intelligence algorithm to play the game.</p><br>
