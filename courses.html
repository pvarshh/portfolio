				<p>Mandated by the Economics Department, 45% of students in this course will earn a grade in the A range, and 85% of students of students will earn a grade in the A-B range</p>

				<h3>ECON 102: Introduction to Economics II</h3>
				<p>The fundamental concepts and theories of macroeconomics are developed and used to analyze problems of current interest. The major concerns of this course are the determinants of GDP, unemployment, inflation, international trade, and economic growth.</p>
				<p>Mandated by the Economics Department, 45% of students in this course will earn a grade in the A range, and 85% of students of students will earn a grade in the A-B range</p>

				<h3>MATH 215: Multivariable & Vector Calculus</h3>
				<p>The emphasis in Math 215 is on concepts and solving problems rather than theory and proof. Some topics include: Vectors, Vector Functions, Functions of Two and Three Variables, Partial Derivatives, Optimization (including Lagrange multipliers), Multiple Integrals, Calculus of Vector Field, Line Integrals and Surface Integrals, Green's, Stokes', and Divergence Theorems.</p>

				<h3>STATS 250: Statistics and Data Analysis</h3>
				<p>A one term course in applied statistical methodology from an analysis-of-data viewpoint. Frequency distributions; measures of location; mean, median, mode; measures of dispersion; variance; graphic presentation; elementary probability; populations and samples; sampling distributions; one sample univariate inference problems, and two sample problems; categorical data; regression and correlation; and analysis of variance.</p>

				<h3>EECS 183: Elementary Programming Concepts</h3>
				<p>Fundamental concepts and skills of programming in a high-level language. Flow of control: selection, iteration, subroutines. Data structures: strings, arrays, lists.
