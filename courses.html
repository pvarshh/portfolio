				<h2>Courses Taken</h2>
					
				<h3>ECON 101: Introduction to Economics I</h3>
				<p>This course concentrates on microeconomics: how markets function, what markets do well, where markets do not work well, the distribution of income and wealth, the public sector, international trade, and environmental economics.</p>
				<p>Mandated by the Economics Department, 45% of students in this course will earn a grade in the A range, and 85% of students of students will earn a grade in the A-B range</p>

				<h3>ECON 102: Introduction to Economics II (transfer)</h3>
				<p>The fundamental concepts and theories of macroeconomics are developed and used to analyze problems of current interest. The major concerns of this course are the determinants of GDP, unemployment, inflation, international trade, and economic growth.</p>
				<p>Mandated by the Economics Department, 45% of students in this course will earn a grade in the A range, and 85% of students of students will earn a grade in the A-B range</p>

				<h3>MATH 215: Multivariable & Vector Calculus (transfer)</h3>
				<p>The emphasis in Math 215 is on concepts and solving problems rather than theory and proof. Some topics include: Vectors, Vector Functions, Functions of Two and Three Variables, Partial Derivatives, Optimization (including Lagrange multipliers), Multiple Integrals, Calculus of Vector Field, Line Integrals and Surface Integrals, Green's, Stokes', and Divergence Theorems.</p>

				<h3>STATS 250: Statistics and Data Analysis</h3>
				<p>A one term course in applied statistical methodology from an analysis-of-data viewpoint. Frequency distributions; measures of location; mean, median, mode; measures of dispersion; variance; graphic presentation; elementary probability; populations and samples; sampling distributions; one sample univariate inference problems, and two sample problems; categorical data; regression and correlation; and analysis of variance.</p>

				<h3>EECS 183: Elementary Programming Concepts</h3>
				<p>Fundamental concepts and skills of programming in a high-level language. Flow of control: selection, iteration, subroutines. Data structures: strings, arrays, lists. Algorithms using selection and iteration (decision making, finding maxima/minima, searching, sorting, simulation, etc.). Good program design, structure and style are emphasized along with testing and debugging.</p>

				<h2>Courses Taking</h2>

				<h3>COMPFOR 131: Python Programming for the Sciences</h3>
				<p>This hands-on interactive course introduces students to the Python programming language in order to provide natural science students with foundational aspects of programming including computational analysis, the structure, organization and manipulation of data, sound coding practices, and visualization of scientific information.</p>

				<h3>EECS 203: Discrete Mathematics</h3>
				<p>Introduction to the mathematical foundations of computer science. Topics covered include: prepositional and predicate logic, set theory, function and relations, growth of functions and asymptotic notation, introduction to algorithms, elementary combinatorics, and graph theory, and discrete probability theory.</p>
					
				<h3>EECS 280: Programming and Introductory Data Structures</h3>
				<p>Algorithm development and effective programming, top-down analysis, structured programming, testing, and program correctness. Program language syntax and static and runtime semantics. Scope, procedure instantiation, recursion, abstract data types, and parameter passing methods. Structured data types, pointers, linked data structures, stacks, queues, arrays, records, and trees.</p>
